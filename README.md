## Functionality: 

On page load, the application sends an API request to fetch Bicycles and Accessories from a remote database.  
Products are displayed on product cards containing quantity selectors, which are rendered in responsive grid.
Updating a product's quantity will add/remove it from the shopping cart.
Clicking the cart icon displays a summary of the shopping cart contents, as well as a checkout button.
Accessories can only be checked out with a bike selection.
